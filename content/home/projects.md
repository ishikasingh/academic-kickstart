  1. Theoretically proved uncertainty of convergence of Stochastic variant of Accelerated GD (SAGD) for minimax problems, even though various practical implementations worked better than the deterministic version in terms of time complexity on large size problems.
  2. Proposed and proved convergence of 2 stochastic algorithms for general non-smooth minimax problems (convex-concave, strongly convex-concave). Further, formulated stochastic version of [Efficient Algorithms for Smooth Minimax Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01543) for non-convex-concave problems.
