I am a PhD student at USC, advised by [Prof. Jesse Thomason](https://jessethomason.com/). My research interests are across NLP and robotics; primarily around why (how) language is necessary for (can be utilized in) robot learning and embodied AI. I think that problems under Embodied AI are yet more foundational, and hold deep-rooted benefits for the society.

Previously, I was an undergrad at IIT Kanpur, where I worked on topics relating to NLP and theoretical ML with [Prof. Ashutosh Modi](https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/) (IIT-K), [Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/) (IIT-K), and [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/pengtaoxie2008/) ([UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/)). I have spent some summers interning at [Adobe Research](https://adobe.ly/3irCKbn), where I also received the [Adobe India WIT Scholarship 2020](https://adobe.ly/2Sl1VkY), and [NVIDIA SRL](https://nvidia_srl.gitlab.io/).

<!--
I am also a part of [Brain & Cognitive Society (BCS)](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/) at IIT-K, currently leading the group, where I organize interesting [talks](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/journal-club/) and collaborate/mentor [projects](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/events/2020/05/01/Summer-Projects-2020.html). I have also been an Academic Mentor to freshers for 1st year Mathematics Courses offered at IIT-K.


My research agenda pertains to modeling interpretable intelligent machines with ethics and emotions incorporated. I have worked on topics subsumed under human-centred AI, i.e., an AI that serves and understands humans. I started with a project on "Brain-Computer Interface" during my 1st year of college, and tried to understand human thoughts. It motivated me to explore human thinking further, and I approached it from a more applicative direction via  "Predicting Web Browsing Patterns" under the supervision of [Prof. Nisheeth](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/). To comprehend as well as express efficiently, AI must understand emotions. This idea led me to a project on "Affective Language Modelling" supervised by [Prof. Ashutosh Modi](https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/). I also have some inclination towards mathematics, hence I pursued research work in theoretical ML as well. I worked on "Differentially Private ML" under [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/pengtaoxie2008/) and on "Stochastic Minimax Optimization Algorithms". I am also a part of [Brain & Cognitive Society (BCS)](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/) at IIT Kanpur, currently leading the group. To make a better use of what I have learnt, I'm mentoring summer projects offered by BCS (proposed by me) on "Object-Oriented RL" and "Tweet Sentiment Extraction". I have also been an Academic Mentor to freshers for 1st year Mathematics Courses offered at IIT Kanpur.

In my leisure time, I participated in a competition ([TechnoUtsav 2.0](https://technoutsav.techgig.com/)) organized by Deloitte, and my idea on "Intelligent Energy Harvesting" won the Grand Prize. My team was invited to [US India Analytics Summit 2019](https://twitter.com/DeloitteIndia/status/1126423884243382273), where I also met my youngest inspiration [Tanmay Bakshi](https://twitter.com/ishika3singh/status/1127609377874108416). In 2020, [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) selected me for [Adobe India WIT Scholarship](https://adobe.ly/2Sl1VkY). I have spent sometime in electrochemical research as well under [Prof. Raj Pala](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rpala/). He has been a constant source of encouragement and knowledge (and fresh/smart jokes :P) to me.


Apart from research, I like to spend time [writing](https://medium.com/@ishikasingh95) about my philosophical thoughts and [painting (traditional art)](https://www.deviantart.com/ishikasingh95). To know more, contact me on your favorite interface from the menu on your left. I am most efficient with emails and twitter.
