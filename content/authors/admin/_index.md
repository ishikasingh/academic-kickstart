I am a final year undergrad at IIT Kanpur. I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Ashutosh Modi](https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/) and [Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/) at IITK. I've also had the pleasure of being supervised by [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/pengtaoxie2008/) as a research intern at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I've spent one of my summers interning at [Adobe Research](https://adobe.ly/3irCKbn). I've mostly worked in NLP and theoretical ML. My research interests are across NLP, RL, ML theory; primarily around why (how) language is necessary for (can be utilized in) robot learning.

I am also a part of [Brain & Cognitive Society (BCS)](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/) at IIT Kanpur, currently leading the group, where I organize interesting talks and collaborate/mentor projects. I have also been an Academic Mentor to freshers for 1st year Mathematics Courses offered at IIT Kanpur.

<!--
My research agenda pertains to modeling interpretable intelligent machines with ethics and emotions incorporated. I have worked on topics subsumed under human-centred AI, i.e., an AI that serves and understands humans. I started with a project on "Brain-Computer Interface" during my 1st year of college, and tried to understand human thoughts. It motivated me to explore human thinking further, and I approached it from a more applicative direction via  "Predicting Web Browsing Patterns" under the supervision of [Prof. Nisheeth](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/). To comprehend as well as express efficiently, AI must understand emotions. This idea led me to a project on "Affective Language Modelling" supervised by [Prof. Ashutosh Modi](https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/). I also have some inclination towards mathematics, hence I pursued research work in theoretical ML as well. I worked on "Differentially Private ML" under [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/pengtaoxie2008/) and on "Stochastic Minimax Optimization Algorithms". I am also a part of [Brain & Cognitive Society (BCS)](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/) at IIT Kanpur, currently leading the group. To make a better use of what I have learnt, I'm mentoring summer projects offered by BCS (proposed by me) on "Object-Oriented RL" and "Tweet Sentiment Extraction". I have also been an Academic Mentor to freshers for 1st year Mathematics Courses offered at IIT Kanpur.-->

In my leisure time, I participated in a competition ([TechnoUtsav 2.0](https://technoutsav.techgig.com/)) organized by Deloitte, and my idea on "Intelligent Energy Harvesting" won the Grand Prize. My team was invited to [US India Analytics Summit 2019](https://twitter.com/DeloitteIndia/status/1126423884243382273), where I met my youngest inspiration [Tanmay Bakshi](https://twitter.com/ishika3singh/status/1127609377874108416). All of my efforts were appreciated by [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), and I am very grateful to them that they selected me for [Adobe India WIT 2020 Scholarship](https://adobe.ly/2Sl1VkY). Special mention: I have spent sometime in electrochemical research as well under [Prof. Raj Pala](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rpala/). He has been a constant source of encouragement and knowledge (and fresh/smart jokes :P) to me.

(I am cooler than you think :P) I also spend time [writing](https://medium.com/@ishikasingh95) about my philosophical thoughts and have a predilection towards [painting (traditional art)](https://www.deviantart.com/ishikasingh95). To know more about me, or my projects, or hire me, or to just chat, contact on your favorite interface from the menu on your left. I'm most efficient with emails and twitter.
